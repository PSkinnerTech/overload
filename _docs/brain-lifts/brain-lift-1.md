# Brain Lift #1: Should We Build Our Own Task Management Core?

## The Current Situation

We've built a solid foundation for Overload with Motion API integration, but we're facing a significant UX challenge: Motion only supports API key authentication, which requires users to:

1. Navigate to Motion's settings
2. Copy an API key
3. Configure it in our app
4. Hope Motion doesn't change their API

This creates friction in what should be a seamless onboarding experience.

## The Pivot Proposal

Instead of relying on Motion's API, we could build our own task management core that works similarly to Motion but gives us full control over the user experience and data flow.

## What This Change Would Look Like

### 1. Core Data Models We'd Need to Build

```typescript
// Task Model
interface Task {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  description?: string;
  dueDate?: Date;
  scheduledDate?: Date;
  duration: number; // minutes
  priority: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high' | 'urgent';
  status: 'pending' | 'in_progress' | 'completed' | 'cancelled';
  projectId?: string;
  tags: string[];
  effort?: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high';
  recurrence?: RecurrenceRule;
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
}

// Project Model
interface Project {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  color: string;
  description?: string;
  isArchived: boolean;
}

// Schedule Block Model
interface ScheduleBlock {
  id: string;
  taskId: string;
  startTime: Date;
  endTime: Date;
  isAutoScheduled: boolean;
}

// Workspace Model (if we want multi-workspace support)
interface Workspace {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  settings: WorkspaceSettings;
}
```

### 2. Features We'd Need to Implement

#### A. Task Management Core
- **Task CRUD Operations**: Create, read, update, delete tasks
- **Task Scheduling**: Ability to schedule tasks for specific times
- **Task Prioritization**: Sort and filter by priority
- **Task Status Management**: Track progress through different states
- **Bulk Operations**: Update multiple tasks at once

#### B. Smart Scheduling (Motion's Key Feature)
- **Auto-scheduling Algorithm**: Automatically place tasks in calendar based on:
  - Due dates
  - Priority levels
  - Available time slots
  - Task duration estimates
  - Energy levels (morning vs. afternoon tasks)
- **Calendar Integration**: 
  - Read calendar events to find free time
  - Avoid scheduling during meetings
  - Respect working hours preferences
- **Rescheduling Logic**: Automatically adjust when tasks overrun

#### C. Data Import Options
- **CSV Import**: For bulk task creation
- **Calendar Integration**: 
  - Google Calendar API (OAuth2 available!)
  - Apple Calendar (EventKit)
  - Outlook Calendar
- **Natural Language Input**: "Meeting with John tomorrow at 2pm for 1 hour"

#### D. Storage & Sync
- **Local SQLite Database**: For offline-first operation
- **Optional Cloud Sync**: 
  - Build our own sync service
  - Or use existing solutions (Supabase, Firebase)
- **Conflict Resolution**: Handle edits from multiple devices

### 3. Technical Implementation Approach

#### Phase 1: Local-First MVP (2-3 weeks)
```typescript
// Using SQLite with TypeORM or Prisma
class TaskService {
  async createTask(task: CreateTaskDto): Promise<Task> {
    // Validate task data
    // Save to local database
    // Trigger auto-scheduling if needed
    // Emit event for UI update
  }

  async getTasksForDateRange(start: Date, end: Date): Promise<Task[]> {
    // Query local database
    // Include scheduled blocks
    // Calculate overload metrics
  }

  async autoScheduleTask(taskId: string): Promise<ScheduleBlock> {
    // Find available time slots
    // Consider task priority and duration
    // Create schedule block
    // Update task status
  }
}
```

#### Phase 2: Smart Scheduling (3-4 weeks)
```typescript
class AutoScheduler {
  async scheduleUnscheduledTasks(): Promise<void> {
    const unscheduledTasks = await this.getUnscheduledTasks();
    const availableSlots = await this.findAvailableTimeSlots();
    
    for (const task of unscheduledTasks) {
      const bestSlot = this.findBestSlotForTask(task, availableSlots);
      if (bestSlot) {
        await this.scheduleTaskInSlot(task, bestSlot);
      }
    }
  }

  private findBestSlotForTask(
    task: Task, 
    slots: TimeSlot[]
  ): TimeSlot | null {
    // Consider task priority
    // Match task energy requirements with time of day
    // Ensure slot is large enough for task duration
    // Prefer slots closer to due date
    // Avoid context switching between different project types
  }
}
```

#### Phase 3: Calendar Integration (2-3 weeks)
```typescript
class CalendarService {
  async importFromGoogleCalendar(): Promise<Event[]> {
    // Use Google Calendar API (OAuth2 supported!)
    // Import events as blocked time
    // Optional: Import calendar events as tasks
  }

  async syncWithCalendar(): Promise<void> {
    // Two-way sync scheduled tasks
    // Handle conflicts
    // Update both systems
  }
}
```

### 4. Advantages of Building Our Own

1. **Better UX**: No API keys, just create an account and start using
2. **Full Control**: We own the entire experience and can iterate quickly
3. **Custom Features**: Build exactly what Overload needs, not limited by Motion's API
4. **Offline-First**: Works without internet, syncs when connected
5. **Privacy**: User data stays local unless they opt into sync
6. **No API Limits**: No rate limiting or usage restrictions
7. **Integrated AI**: Deeper integration with our overload detection algorithms

### 5. Disadvantages and Challenges

1. **Development Time**: Significant effort to match Motion's core features
2. **Maintenance**: We're responsible for all bugs and features
3. **No Existing Data**: Users can't import their Motion tasks
4. **Feature Parity**: Motion has years of development behind it
5. **Mobile Apps**: Would need separate mobile development
6. **Trust**: Users might hesitate to switch from established tools

### 6. Hybrid Approach: Best of Both Worlds?

Instead of completely abandoning external integrations, we could:

1. **Build our own task core** as the primary interface
2. **Add import options** from various sources:
   - Motion (via API key for one-time import)
   - Google Calendar (OAuth2)
   - Todoist (OAuth2 available)
   - CSV files
3. **Focus on the Overload Detection** as our unique value prop

### 7. Estimated Timeline Comparison

#### Continuing with Motion API
- ✅ Already implemented
- 1 week to polish API key UX
- Ready for overload detection features immediately

#### Building Our Own Core
- 2-3 weeks: Basic task management
- 3-4 weeks: Smart scheduling
- 2-3 weeks: Calendar integrations
- 2 weeks: Polish and testing
- **Total: 9-12 weeks before reaching current functionality**

### 8. Recommendation

Given our goal is to build an **Overload Detection System**, not another task manager, I recommend:

1. **Keep Motion for Now**: Use the existing integration to validate the overload detection concept
2. **Improve API Key UX**: Make it as smooth as possible (in-app configuration)
3. **Build Task Core Later**: Once we prove the overload detection works and gains traction
4. **Add Other Integrations**: Support Todoist, Google Tasks, etc. (many have OAuth2)

The unique value of Overload isn't task management—it's the AI-powered workload analysis. We should focus on that first, then expand our data sources based on user feedback.

### 9. Alternative: Focus on Calendar-First Approach

A simpler alternative might be to pivot to calendar integration first:
- Google Calendar has OAuth2
- Most professionals live in their calendar
- We can analyze meeting density and free time
- Add manual task input for things not in calendar
- Much faster to implement (1-2 weeks)

This would give us the data we need for overload detection without building a full task management system.

## Conclusion

Building our own task management core would give us complete control but would delay our core value proposition by 2-3 months. Instead, we should:

1. Polish the current Motion integration (1 week)
2. Ship the overload detection MVP
3. Get user feedback
4. Then decide whether to build our own or add more integrations

The goal is to help users understand and manage their workload, not to build another task manager. Let's stay focused on that unique value.
