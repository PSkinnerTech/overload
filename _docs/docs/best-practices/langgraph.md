# LangGraph Best Practices

LangGraph is the core AI orchestration engine for Aurix. It allows us to build complex, stateful, and resilient AI workflows. This document outlines the best practices we will follow for its implementation, based on the official [LangGraph documentation](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/).

## 1. Define a Clear, Typed State

The foundation of any LangGraph workflow is its state. A well-defined state object is critical for building a readable and maintainable graph.

-   **DO** use TypeScript's `TypedDict` to create a strict type for your graph's state. This provides compile-time safety and excellent autocompletion. [[citation:https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/tutorials/get-started/1-build-basic-chatbot/]]
-   **DO** use the `Annotated` type with `add_messages` for any `messages` key in the state. This ensures that new messages are appended to the history rather than overwriting it, which is essential for conversational memory. [[citation:https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/tutorials/get-started/1-build-basic-chatbot/]]
-   **DON'T** put large, complex, unstructured data directly into the state. Instead, process and refine data in each node, adding only the necessary, structured information back to the state.

```typescript
// Good: A clearly defined state for our voice-to-doc workflow
import { Annotated } from 'langgraph/graph';
import { BaseMessage } from '@langchain/core/messages';

interface WorkflowState {
  rawTranscript: string;
  documentType: 'technical' | 'meeting' | 'general';
  sections: Array<{ title: string; content: string }>;
  diagrams: Array<{ title:string; mermaidCode: string }>;
  finalDocument: string;
  // Use add_messages for conversation history
  messages: Annotated<BaseMessage[], typeof add_messages>;
  errors: string[];
}
```

## 2. Build Modular, Single-Purpose Nodes

Each node in the graph should have a single, well-defined responsibility. This makes the graph easier to debug, test, and modify.

-   **DO** break down complex logic into smaller, distinct nodes (e.g., `transcription_node`, `analysis_node`, `diagram_generation_node`).
-   **DON'T** create a single, monolithic "do-everything" node. This is an anti-pattern that defeats the purpose of a graph structure.
-   **DO** ensure each node takes the `State` object as input and returns a `Partial<State>` object with only the fields it has modified.

## 3. Use Conditional Edges for Robust Routing

Conditional edges are the key to creating intelligent, resilient workflows. They allow the graph to make decisions based on its current state.

-   **DO** use conditional edges to route the workflow based on the output of an analysis node (e.g., routing to `technical_doc_generator` vs. `meeting_notes_generator`).
-   **DO** use conditional edges for error handling. A node that can fail should have a conditional edge that routes to an `error_handler_node` if the state contains an error.
-   **DON'T** create long, linear chains of nodes. The power of LangGraph comes from its ability to branch and loop.

```typescript
// Good: A router that directs the workflow based on an analysis step
function route_document_type(state: WorkflowState) {
  if (state.errors.length > 0) {
    return 'error_handler';
  }
  switch (state.documentType) {
    case 'technical':
      return 'technical_doc_generator';
    case 'meeting':
      return 'meeting_notes_generator';
    default:
      return 'general_doc_generator';
  }
}

workflow.addConditionalEdges('analysis_node', route_document_type);
```

## 4. Implement Human-in-the-Loop for Quality Control

For complex tasks like ours, AI will not be perfect 100% of the time. Building in points for human intervention is crucial for a high-quality user experience.

-   **DO** add an `interrupt_before` flag when compiling the graph for nodes that require user approval (e.g., `human_review_node`). This will pause the graph's execution. [[citation:https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/tutorials/get-started/4-human-in-the-loop/]]
-   **DO** design the UI to handle these interruptions, presenting the user with the current state and clear options to either approve, edit, or regenerate the content.
-   **DO** allow the user's feedback to be added back into the graph's state so subsequent nodes can use it to improve their output.

## 5. Leverage Checkpointers for Memory and Resilience

Checkpointers are the mechanism for providing memory and resilience to your graph. For a desktop application like Aurix, this is a killer feature.

-   **DO** use a `SqliteSaver` or similar persistent checkpointer to save the state of a workflow. This allows the user to close the application and resume a long-running documentation session later. [[citation:https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/tutorials/get-started/3-add-memory/]]
-   **DO** use a unique `thread_id` for each session when invoking the graph. This is the key that allows the checkpointer to save and load the correct conversation history.
-   **DO** use the "time-travel" capability provided by checkpoints to allow users to undo steps or revert to a previous version of their document, which provides a powerful and forgiving editing experience. [[citation:https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/tutorials/get-started/6-time-travel/]]

By following these best practices, we can build a sophisticated, robust, and user-friendly AI engine for Aurix that is both powerful and maintainable.
